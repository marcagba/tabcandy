# Installation #

Tab Candy does not yet have an auto install. To install it manually:

  1. Download http://tabcandy.googlecode.com/files/tabcandy.zip and unzip it somewhere on your hard drive.
  1. Rename the resulting folder "tabcandy@aza.raskin".
  1. Find your Firefox profiles folder:
    * Mac: /Users/`<user>`/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles
    * Windows7/Vista: C:\Users\`<user>`\AppData\Roaming\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles
    * See http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/profiles for more info
  1. Open the folder for the profile you want to install into (if you haven't set up profiles, there will be just one folder).
  1. Move the tab candy folder into the extensions folder inside the profile folder.
  1. Restart Firefox.

# Getting Started #

Enter this URL into the awesome bar:

chrome://tabcandy/content/candies/revision-a/index.html

This is the Tab Candy page for Revision A. You can use the menu in the upper left of the page to switch between different candies, but Revision A is the main one at the moment.

We recommend making the Tab Candy page your left-most tab, as then you can easily get to it with command-1 (one).

# Using Tab Candy #

Each thumbnail on the screen represents one of your open pages. Click on one to go to that page. You can drag the tabs around to organize them as you please, and drag them on top of each other to form groups.
